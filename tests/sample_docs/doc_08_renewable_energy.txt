Renewable energy is crucial for achieving net-zero emissions. Solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal power are replacing fossil fuels as the primary sources of electricity generation worldwide.

Major renewable energy sources:
- Solar: Photovoltaic panels and concentrated solar power
- Wind: Onshore and offshore wind turbines
- Hydroelectric: Dams and run-of-river systems
- Geothermal: Underground heat extraction
- Biomass: Organic materials for fuel

Advantages of renewable energy:
- Zero or low greenhouse gas emissions during operation
- Abundant and naturally replenished resources
- Decreasing costs making them competitive with fossil fuels
- Energy independence and security

Challenges include intermittency, storage requirements, and grid integration. Battery technology and smart grids are being developed to address these issues.
