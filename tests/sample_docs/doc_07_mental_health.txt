Mental health awareness has grown significantly in recent years, reducing stigma and encouraging people to seek help. Mental health conditions affect one in four people globally and include depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.

Factors affecting mental health:
- Biological: Genetics, brain chemistry, hormones
- Psychological: Trauma, abuse, neglect
- Social: Relationships, work stress, economic hardship
- Environmental: Living conditions, access to healthcare

Treatment approaches:
- Psychotherapy: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), counseling
- Medication: Antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications
- Lifestyle changes: Exercise, sleep, nutrition
- Support networks: Family, friends, support groups

Organizations like the World Health Organization are working to integrate mental health services into primary healthcare systems worldwide.
