Blockchain technology underlies cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum but has applications far beyond digital currencies. A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions across multiple computers.

Core features of blockchain:
- Decentralization: No single point of control
- Immutability: Records cannot be altered after confirmation
- Transparency: All participants can view the ledger
- Security: Cryptographic hashing ensures data integrity

Applications beyond cryptocurrency:
- Supply chain tracking and verification
- Digital identity management
- Smart contracts for automated agreements
- Voting systems with transparent audit trails
- Healthcare records management

The technology continues to evolve with improvements in scalability, energy efficiency, and interoperability between different blockchain networks.
