Gene editing technology, particularly CRISPR-Cas9, has revolutionized biology and medicine. CRISPR allows scientists to precisely modify DNA sequences, enabling treatments for genetic diseases and advances in agriculture.

How CRISPR works:
1. Guide RNA directs the Cas9 protein to a specific DNA location
2. Cas9 cuts the DNA at the target site
3. Cell repair mechanisms insert, delete, or replace genetic material

Medical applications:
- Treating sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia
- Developing CAR-T cell therapy for cancer
- Researching treatments for muscular dystrophy
- Creating disease-resistant crops

Ethical considerations include germline editing, genetic enhancement, and accessibility of treatments. International guidelines and regulations are being developed to govern the responsible use of this powerful technology.
