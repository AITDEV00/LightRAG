Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computational power. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously through superposition.

Key concepts in quantum computing:
- Superposition: Qubits can be 0, 1, or both at once
- Entanglement: Quantum particles can be correlated across distances
- Quantum interference: Manipulating probability amplitudes for computation

Applications include:
- Drug discovery and molecular simulation
- Cryptography and secure communications
- Optimization problems in logistics and finance
- Machine learning acceleration

Companies like IBM, Google, and Microsoft are racing to achieve quantum advantage, where quantum computers can solve problems beyond classical capabilities.
