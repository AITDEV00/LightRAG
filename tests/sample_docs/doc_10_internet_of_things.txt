The Internet of Things (IoT) connects billions of devices worldwide, creating smart homes, cities, and industries. IoT devices collect and exchange data, enabling automation and intelligent decision-making.

IoT applications:
- Smart homes: Thermostats, lighting, security systems
- Healthcare: Wearable monitors, remote patient monitoring
- Manufacturing: Predictive maintenance, quality control
- Transportation: Connected vehicles, traffic management
- Agriculture: Soil sensors, automated irrigation

Key technologies enabling IoT:
- Low-power sensors and actuators
- Wireless protocols: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LoRaWAN, 5G
- Cloud computing for data processing
- Edge computing for real-time analysis
- Machine learning for pattern recognition

Security and privacy remain major concerns as more devices become connected, requiring robust encryption and authentication mechanisms.
