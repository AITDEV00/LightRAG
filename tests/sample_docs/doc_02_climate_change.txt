Climate change represents one of the most pressing challenges of our time. Global temperatures have risen by approximately 1.1°C since pre-industrial times, leading to more frequent extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and ecosystem disruptions.

The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, aims to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Countries worldwide are implementing strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through:
- Transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar and wind
- Improving energy efficiency in buildings and transportation
- Protecting and restoring forests that act as carbon sinks
- Developing carbon capture and storage technologies

Individual actions, corporate responsibility, and government policies all play crucial roles in addressing this global crisis.
