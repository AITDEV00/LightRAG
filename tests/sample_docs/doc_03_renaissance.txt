The Renaissance was a period of cultural, artistic, and intellectual rebirth that began in Italy in the 14th century and spread throughout Europe. This era marked the transition from medieval to modern times and fundamentally changed art, science, and philosophy.

Key figures of the Renaissance include:
- Leonardo da Vinci: Artist, inventor, and polymath known for the Mona Lisa
- Michelangelo: Sculptor and painter who created the Sistine Chapel ceiling
- Galileo Galilei: Astronomer who championed heliocentrism
- William Shakespeare: Playwright whose works defined English literature

The Renaissance emphasized humanism, classical learning, and the pursuit of knowledge, laying the groundwork for the Age of Enlightenment and modern scientific inquiry.
